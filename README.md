# Clink

This is Clink, a fork of [Blink](https://github.com/blinksh/blink), but has much more functions.

## Roadmap

- [ ] a way to install and manage extensions (maybe in lua)
- [ ] more network tools support
- [ ] full native git support (maybe svn as well)
- [ ] more ways to get remote files, like ftp, smb or webdav
- [ ] vim, nano (and maybe emacs) you want. Forget ed!
- [ ] no fking "get more free time!" screen FOREVER

### Perhaps in consideration

- [ ] customizable Blink Shell prompt for a completely cool shell
- [ ] a better extension for VSCode to let you run commands in Terminal
- [ ] native VSCode for iPad! (but very hard)
